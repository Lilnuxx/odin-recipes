In this project , I learned the basics of html which includes the tags named list(ordered & unordered) , image , anchor tag & paragraph.Also their corresponding attributes like height , width , target & rel attribute when linking a page etc.
rel increases the security of the website .
Also I increased the size of the links by enveloping them in h3 tag :).
